predator prey system numerically using Matlab building function ode45

[Task-1]
Solve the following predator prey system numerically using Matlab building function ode45 and Plot the resulting populations against time.
Initial conditions:[ 4, 12 ]

x′(t)	=	4x(t)−7x(t)y(t)

y′(t)	=−9y(t) + 7x(t)y(t)
 
Note: The variables x and y measure the sizes of the prey and predator populations, respectively.

[Task-2]
Find the numerical solutions of flowing ordinary differential equations with initial value problems by Euler’s Method, Modified Euler’s Method and Runge- Kutta Methods of 4th order. Also find the analytical solution using MATLAB Command “dsolve” and compare your results.
𝑦′′  − 4𝑦′  + 4𝑦 = 0	𝑦(0) = 1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑦′(0) = 2, ℎ = 0.1

[Task-3]
Find the numerical solutions of flowing nonlinear initial value problems using Matlab building function ode45
𝑦′  + 3𝑦2 = 0	𝑦(0) = 1

[Task-4]
Solve the following second-order BVP in MATLAB using “bvp4c”
y′′+y=0.
 
subject to the boundary conditions
 
y(0)=0,
y(π/2)=2.
